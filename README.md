# Penrose-Diagrams
An algorithm for the construction of the Penrose diagram using the space-time metric for both Minkowski and Schwarzschild 
metric is presented in Both.nb
Penrose diagram for the geometrical observation of the formation of Schwarzschild black hole from an infalling shell of
photons is presented in Complete_Penrose_Schwarzschid.nb by merging the geometries along the trajectory of the shell.
